This is an extension for Visual Studio Code that tweeks it behavior a bit to include
a few things I feel are missing. It is mostly for personal use although any one who also
wants these features is more than welcome to use it ofcourse.


### Cut to end of line
This command is will cut the text starting at the character under the cursor
and ending with the character at the end of the line and place it on your clipboard.
